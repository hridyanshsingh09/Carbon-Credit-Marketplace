# 🌍 Carbon Credit Marketplace

## ♻️ Overview

**Carbon Credit Marketplace** is a decentralized blockchain-based platform that enables individuals, organizations, and governments to **buy, sell, and trade verified carbon credits** in a transparent and traceable manner.
The goal is to **incentivize sustainability** by providing a secure, trustless ecosystem for carbon offset transactions through **NFT tokenization** and **smart contracts**.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🌱 **Tokenized Carbon Credits** – Each carbon credit is minted as an NFT representing one verified metric ton of CO₂ offset.
* 🔗 **Blockchain Transparency** – Every transaction is recorded immutably, ensuring trust and traceability.
* 💰 **Marketplace for Trading** – Buy, sell, or retire carbon credits using cryptocurrency.
* 🧾 **Verification System** – Integrates APIs or oracles from certified environmental organizations (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard).
* 🧮 **Automatic Retirement** – Smart contracts handle the permanent removal (retirement) of credits once used.
* 🪙 **Reward System** – Earn tokens for sustainable actions, verified by IoT or partner organizations.
